# The Kobayashi Maru (Redux)

Two years ago [I wrote](2016-06-21-the-kobayashi-maru.md) that:

> 2016 is the [Kobayashi Maru scenario](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru) of Western democracy.

I still stand by this statement, though today I might say instead:

> The first decades of the 21st Century are the Kobayashi Maru scenario of Western democracy.

I think that many more people might agree with me now. After all, thereâ€™s a lot of talk these days about how weâ€™re all well and truly fucked, from our economies to our environment to our politics.

But in all this acknowledgment of the fucked-ness of our collective future, I do think that we tend to forget one thingâ€¦

The most important part of the [Kobayashi Maru scenario](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru) is *not* that it is impossible to win. It is that, in facing the impossibility of winning, we reveal the true content of our character.
