I still stand by this statement, though today I might say instead:

I think that many more people might agree with me now. After all, there's a lot of talk these days about how we're all well and truly fucked, from our economies to our environment to our politics.

But in all this acknowledgment of the fucked-ness of our collective future, I do think that we tend to forget one thing…

The most important part of the Kobayashi Maru scenario is *not* that it is impossible to win. It is that, in facing the impossibility of winning, we reveal the true content of our character.
