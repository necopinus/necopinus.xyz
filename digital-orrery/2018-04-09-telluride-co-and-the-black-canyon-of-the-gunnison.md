# Telluride, CO and the Black Canyon of the Gunnison

Every year Len Montgomery and I take a short vacation around her birthday. For 2018 we decided to spend a couple of days in Telluride, CO. On the way back we stopped by one of my favorite (and I think, under-rated) national parks, the Black Canyon of the Gunnison.
