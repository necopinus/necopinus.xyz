# Coast to Coast

A combination of astute planning and sheer luck/misfortune saw me traveling from San Francisco, to Louisville, Kentucky, to Washington, DC over the course of two and a half weeks.

## San Francisco

A spider in Redwood Regional Park.

There were a surprising number of spiders in the park‚Ä¶ And surprisingly few birds.
