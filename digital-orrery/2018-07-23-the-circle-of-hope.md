# The Circle of HOPE

This year I attended HOPE 12, [The Circle of HOPE](https://xii.hope.net/). ‚ÄúHOPE‚Äù stands for ‚ÄúHackers on Planet Earth‚Äù, and is one of the older hacker conferences in the US. It‚Äôs put on every other year by the crew from [2600 Magazine](https://www.2600.com/).

Attending HOPE is something I‚Äôve wanted to do for a long time. While I didn‚Äôt take any photos in the conference itself, these are a few photos I took around the event.
