Looking west along the Malad River from the north rim of the Malad River Gorge. Near the center of the shadows at left, a small waterfall from an irrigation canal can be seen.

Sage growing on the plateau above the Malad River. The darker green in the distance is trees growing along an irrigation canal… The same one that can be seen in some other shots emptying into the Malad River Gorge as a waterfall.

Looking east from the south rim of the Malad River Gorge. The pedestrian bridge at the eastern end of the state park and I-84 can be seen in the distance. Just below the bridge is the small waterfall where the Malad River enters the canyon. If you look closely at the shadows on the right, you can see a small waterfall where an irrigation canal empties into the gorge.

## Shoshone Falls

Shoshone Falls along the Snake River. The tall red-roofed building at center-left is a small hydroelectric power plant (as is the smaller gray building adjoining it to the right).

Looking northwest across a collapsed lava tube near Shoshone Ice Cave (which is itself part of a lava tube). The low, black mound in the distance is Black Butte, a low shield volcano that produced the lava field in this photo.

![A U-shaped cavern whose floor is covered in a solid, flat layer of ice](assets/2018-06-27-idaho-44.webp)

Shoshone Ice Cave. On the floor is a thin layer of water, and then 8 – 12 feet of solid ice. The standing water is continuously pumped out of the cave, which would otherwise completely fill up with ice in a few years.

## Craters of the Moon

![Desert scrubland abruptly ends in a dark, jagged lava field](assets/2018-06-27-idaho-45.webp)

Looking approximately east-southeast from an overlook  near the Craters of the Moon visitors center. A couple of different lava flows can be seen in the foreground; on the horizon is the Big Southern Butte, one of the largest volcanic domes on Earth. Craters of the Moon was formed by a series of smaller volcanoes and rifts however; Big Southern Butte is a completely separate feature.

![Desert scrubland abruptly ends in a dark, jagged lava field](assets/2018-06-27-idaho-46.webp)

The lava flows that make up Craters of the Moon (on the left) wash up against a larger field of volcanic cinders that have been colonized by native sage. In the background are five of the cinder cones close to the national monument's entrance. From left-to-right, these are: Big Cinder Butter, Paisely Cone, Inferno Cone, Big Craters, and the North Crater.

![A black, jagged lava field, barely colonized by desert scrub](assets/2018-06-27-idaho-47.webp)

Looking west from a small ridge near the Craters of the Moon visitors center. The red pillars are probably parts of the North Crater (visible on the left side of this panorama); most of the northwest quadrant (not visible here) of this cinder cone seems to have been destroyed in the eruption that produced this lava flow.

![A black, jagged lava field, barely colonized by desert scrub](assets/2018-06-27-idaho-48.webp)

Parts of the North Crater (just off the left-hand side of the frame) that were carried away in the lava flow originating in the eruption that destroyed most of the northwest quadrant of that cinder cone.

![Three distinctive rock pillars rise out of a jagged lava field](assets/2018-06-27-idaho-51.webp)

Parts of the North Crater, embedded in the lava flow that destroyed much of that cinder cone. Behind (and largely obscured) by these pillars is Sunset Crater.

Looking north-northeast across the foot of Inferno Cone. Paisley Cone is right-of-center in the mid-distance; the large, rounded mountain mid-left in the distance is Timbered Dome. In the foreground, dwarf buckwheat blossoms in the cinders making up Inferno Cone.
