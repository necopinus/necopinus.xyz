# Pat & Emily’s Wedding

Photos from my friends’ Pat Kelly-Fischer and Emily Kelly-Fischer’s wedding near Winter Park, Colorado. This set of photos sold me on the power of the combination of the Pixelbook’s pen and Adobe Photoshop Lightroom CC.

Pat Kelly-Fischer & Emily Kelly-Fischer’s wedding cake. The figurines are Emily Kelly-Fischer’s grandmother’s (the dog and cat, for Hudson and Blackbeard respectively, are new). Emily Kelly-Fischer baked the cake herself.

David Rossini takes his daughter Eliza Chafetz Rossini for a walk just after Pat Kelly-Fischer & Emily Kelly-Fischer’s wedding ceremony. (She wasn’t quite able to walk on her own at this point, hence the support.)

Looking east just before sunset. Not the best photo, but it’s interesting to compare with the next one, which was taken almost an hour later from the same spot.
