# Pat & Emilyâ€™s Wedding

Photos from my friendsâ€™ Pat Kelly-Fischer and Emily Kelly-Fischerâ€™s wedding near Winter Park, Colorado. This set of photos sold me on the power of the combination of the Pixelbookâ€™s pen and Adobe Photoshop Lightroom CC.

Pat Kelly-Fischer & Emily Kelly-Fischerâ€™s wedding cake. The figurines are Emily Kelly-Fischerâ€™s grandmotherâ€™s (the dog and cat, for Hudson and Blackbeard respectively, are new). Emily Kelly-Fischer baked the cake herself.

David Rossini takes his daughter Eliza Chafetz Rossini for a walk just after Pat Kelly-Fischer & Emily Kelly-Fischerâ€™s wedding ceremony. (She wasnâ€™t quite able to walk on her own at this point, hence the support.)

Looking east just before sunset. Not the best photo, but itâ€™s interesting to compare with the next one, which was taken almost an hour later from the same spot.
