# Travels in the Southwest Colorado Plateau

A week spent road-tripping to [Arches](https://www.nps.gov/arch/index.htm), [Grand Canyon](https://www.nps.gov/grca/index.htm), and [Bryce Canyon](https://www.nps.gov/brca/index.htm) National Parks, and a few more spots in between.

## Arches National Park
