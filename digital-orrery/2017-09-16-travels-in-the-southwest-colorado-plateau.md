## Arches National Park

![Looking north across Arches National Park](assets/2017-09-16-travels-in-the-southwest-colorado-plateau-01.webp)

Looking north after ascending to the plateau that makes up the majority of Arches National Park. This is well before the first of the arches that are accessible from the main road.

Looking east after ascending into Arches National Park. The first arches are in the far distance; in the mid-distance is a field of "fossilized" sand dunes.

The San Francisco Peaks, the remains of a massive stratovolcano that exploded in a northeasterly direction (towards where I'm standing) about 200,000 years ago.
