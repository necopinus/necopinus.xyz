# Rust & Sky

![A rust-colored metal coil arches from the lower right to upper left of the frame; beyond it is only perfectly clear blue sky](assets/6a86ec6dbbf5982efb90f176c9b55b63.webp)

Part of a series of metal sculptures that used to be located in the small park between the [Denver Performing Arts Complex](http://www.denvercenter.org/) and Speer. This is my favorite of all the pictures I took that day; I really like the way that the ring feels like itâ€™s in motion.
